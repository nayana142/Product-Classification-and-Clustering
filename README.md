# About Dataset
    This dataset was collected from PriceRunner, a popular product comparison platform. It includes 35311 product offers from 10 categories, provided by 306 different merchants. This dataset offers an ideal ground for evaluating classification, clustering, and entity matching algorithms. Although it contains product-related data, it can still be applied to any problem involving text/short-text mining.
